# xbacklight-auto
Got annoyed that this feature is on my phone but not my laptop, now I can get annoyed at writing it instead. Uses the V4L2 API to find out how bright your surroundings are and adjust your backlight accordingly with xbacklight. Open source so you can tell I'm not selling your camera data to the government (not like I could code that anyways).
